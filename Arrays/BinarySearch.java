// Problem statement
// You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer 'target'. 
//Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing. 
//If 'target' is not present in the array 'A', return -1.

// Note:
// You must write an algorithm whose time complexity is O(LogN)


public class Solution {
    public static int search(int []nums, int target) {
        // Write your code here.
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // Avoid overflow with (left + right) / 2
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return -1;  // Target not found
    }
}
