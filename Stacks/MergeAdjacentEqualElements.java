// you are given an integer array nums.
// You must repeatedly apply the following merge operation until no more changes can be made:
// If any two adjacent elements are equal, choose the leftmost such adjacent pair in the current array and replace them with a single element equal to their sum.
// After each merge operation, the array size decreases by 1. Repeat the process on the updated array until no more changes can be made.
// Return the final array after all possible merge operations.
// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,1,1,2]

// Output: [3,4]

// Explanation:

// The middle two elements are equal and merged into 1 + 1 = 2, resulting in [3, 2, 2].
// The last two elements are equal and merged into 2 + 2 = 4, resulting in [3, 4].
// No adjacent equal elements remain. Thus, the answer is [3, 4].
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [2,2,4]

// Output: [8]

// Explanation:

// The first two elements are equal and merged into 2 + 2 = 4, resulting in [4, 4].
// The first two elements are equal and merged into 4 + 4 = 8, resulting in [8].
// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [3,7,5]

// Output: [3,7,5]

// Explanation:

// There are no adjacent equal elements in the array, so no operations are performed.
