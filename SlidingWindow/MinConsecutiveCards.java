// You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the value of the ith card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.

// Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.

// Example 1:

// Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
// Example 2:

// Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= cards.length <= 105
// 0 <= cards[i] <= 106
