// Given a 2D array of characters grid of size m x n, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the same value in grid.

// A cycle is a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, 
//   you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), 
//if it has the same value of the current cell.

// Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1)
//   is invalid because from (1, 2) we visited (1, 1) which was the last visited cell.
// Return true if any cycle of the same value exists in grid, otherwise, return false.
// Example 1:

// Input: grid = [["a","a","a","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","a","a","a"]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: There are two valid cycles shown in different colors in the image below:

// Example 2:



// Input: grid = [["c","c","c","a"],["c","d","c","c"],["c","c","e","c"],["f","c","c","c"]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: There is only one valid cycle highlighted in the image below:

// Example 3:



// Input: grid = [["a","b","b"],["b","z","b"],["b","b","a"]]
// Output: false
